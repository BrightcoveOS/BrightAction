## Introduction Version 1.0
Hello and Welcome to the BrightAction SDK- an ActionScript SDK for working with the Brightcove Media APIs.

BrightAction makes working with the Brightcove Media APIs easier by abstracting away the following common tasks:

* JSON Parsing
* URL Query String contstruction
* De-Serializing Data back from JSON into ActionScript objects
* Self-Documenting the code
